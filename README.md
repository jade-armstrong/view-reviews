# view-reviews
This is a short script that I wrote for interfacing with the WeThinkCode review system. It allows the user to easily view a specified number of reviews and accept them. It also allows the user to see their assigned reviews or view reviews they have for a specific username. It can also give the user the total number of reviews they have graded.
